# Graduate Admissions Dataset Tutorial

Hello there! If you're in this, that means you're hoping to see how some simple data analysis can be done. The goal for this project is to approach something that is commonly known (graduate admissions) and to test our latent biases of what we expect vs what data will show us.

This project goes by the following procedure: 

- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Selection
- Model Training
- Model Comparisons
- Final Thoughts
